# iMac 27" to 5K monitor board

This repository aims at centralizing all the information I found when I crawled the web when doing my iMac 27" conversion to a 5k monitor upcycling project, most of it comming from the MacRumor dedicated thread or Youtube.

It will be to hard to give credit to everyone through the pages so thanks to all MacRumor posters and youtubers.

This is not a step-by-step guide to do a conversion.

## What is a Mac 27" to 5k monitor conversion.

Finding a good 5k 27" monitor is quite hard or very expensive.
This project is basically about buying an old iMac (2014+) stripping it of most, if not all, parts but the display and use a custom video card to power the display.

Starting from there you can build up to also support (more or less easily) some other feature like sound, camera or even USB-C charging. More on this below.
