# Camera

You can use one of the USB port of your board to plug an USB Camera.
The original camera **cannot** be reused, because of its connector.

Here are some model that have proven to work

Mounting the camera can be a bit tricky, it does not fit well the original camera support.

- You can try to adapt it
- You can simply use tape 
- Or you can 3D print.

Credits to him for the pics.
